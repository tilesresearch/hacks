> Implementation of a system proceeds bottom-up. Naturally, becau se modules on higher levels are
clients of those on the lower levels and cannot function without the availability of their imports.
Description of a system, on the other hand, is better ordered in the top-down direction. This is because
a system is designed with its expected applications and functions in mind. - [Project Oberon, The Design of an Operating System and Compiler](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/ProjectOberon1992.pdf) by Ulrike Glavitsch

This repository serves as a tinkering playground and is intended for learning and exploration purposes. Goal is to try lots of things, see what works out, and then gradually improve bit by bit from there.

## Ways

- Each folder should have a specific tinkering task with a corresponding descriptive name.
- It is an individual hacker's responsibility to include easy to follow setup instructions in the README for an out-of-the-box tinkering experience.

## Proposed

- linker
- compml
- tilefile
